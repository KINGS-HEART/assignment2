    </p>
    <p>
      I aim to master the foundations of
      <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, along with modern frameworks
      like <strong>React.js</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I aspire to develop applications that are not only visually appealing but
      also functional and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond technical proficiency, I want to become a well-rounded software
      engineer with strong problem-solving abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      My vision is to work on projects that improve people’s lives, whether
      through better user experiences, accessibility enhancements, or innovative
      software solutions that solve real-world problems.
